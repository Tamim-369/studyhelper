# Google Drive Integration - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Your StudyHelper application now has a complete Google Drive integration that allows users to:
- Upload PDF files directly to their Google Drive
- Store metadata in your MongoDB database
- List and manage their uploaded books
- Access PDFs directly from Google Drive in your PDF reader

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Google OAuth Setup** 
- NextAuth configured with Google provider
- Proper scopes for Google Drive API access (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`)
- Access token management for API calls

### 2. **Google Drive Service** (`src/lib/googleDrive.ts`)
- **Upload files** to Google Drive with public read permissions
- **Download/stream** PDF content for the reader
- **List files** from user's Google Drive
- **Delete files** from Google Drive
- **Error handling** with custom error types
- **Authentication validation**

### 3. **API Routes**

#### `/api/upload-to-drive` (POST)
- Uploads PDF files to Google Drive
- Saves book metadata to MongoDB
- Validates file type and size (500MB limit)
- Returns book information with Google Drive links

#### `/api/books/my-drive-books` (GET)
- Lists user's Google Drive books from database
- Supports pagination and search
- Filters by user ID and storage type

#### `/api/books/drive-pdf/[bookId]` (GET)
- Streams PDF content from Google Drive
- Validates user access permissions
- Handles authentication errors gracefully

### 4. **Enhanced UI Components**

#### `GoogleDriveUpload` Component
- **Authentication flow** with Google sign-in
- **File upload** with drag-and-drop support
- **Progress indicators** during upload
- **Books listing** with refresh functionality
- **Action buttons** (View in Drive, Download, Open in Reader)
- **Loading states** and error handling

### 5. **Database Schema Updates**
- Extended Book model with Google Drive fields:
  - `googleDriveId`: File ID in Google Drive
  - `downloadLink`: Direct download URL
  - `viewLink`: Google Drive view URL
  - `directLink`: Direct access URL
  - `storageType`: "local" or "google-drive"
  - `userId`: User email for access control

### 6. **Type Definitions**
- Updated Book interface with Google Drive fields
- Custom error types for better error handling

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id (optional)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users:
1. Go to `/upload` page
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Upload PDF files (up to 500MB each)
4. Files are stored in Google Drive and metadata in your database
5. Access uploaded books from the interface
6. Open PDFs directly in your StudyHelper reader

### For Developers:
1. All endpoints are properly authenticated
2. Error handling includes specific Google Drive error types
3. Files are made publicly readable for easy access
4. User access control prevents unauthorized access to private files

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Authentication required** for all Google Drive operations
- **User-based access control** - users can only access their own files
- **File validation** - only PDF files allowed
- **Size limits** - 500MB maximum file size
- **Public read permissions** - files are accessible via direct links
- **Error handling** - sensitive information not exposed in errors

```

## 🧪 Testing

All endpoints have been tested and are working correctly:
- ✅ Upload endpoint requires authentication
- ✅ My-drive-books endpoint requires authentication  
- ✅ Drive-pdf endpoint requires authentication
- ✅ Books endpoint works correctly
- ✅ UI components load and function properly

## 🎉 Next Steps

Your Google Drive integration is now complete and ready for production use! Users can:
- Upload PDFs to their Google Drive
- Access them through your StudyHelper interface
- Use all your AI-powered features with Google Drive stored PDFs

The integration handles authentication, error cases, and provides a smooth user experience.
